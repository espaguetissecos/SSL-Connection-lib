# SSL-lconnection-lib
Fully working SSL library (with binding, sending/receiving data functions implemented)

## Synopsis

To test the library, I designed an Echo server and client.
If the server is up, when the client sends a message, the echo replies the same message.
The messages will be encrypted through the SSL protocol.
